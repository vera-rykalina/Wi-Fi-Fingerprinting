# Wi-Fi-Fingerprinting
Objectives:
1. Assess feasibility of Wi-Fi Fingerprinting leverage to
determine a person's location in indoor spaces by
evaluating multiple machine learning models.
2. Apply Received Signal Strength Indicators (RSSI) values
recorded from multiple Wi-Fi hotspots within the building as
input data for modelling.
3. Compare classification (Accuracy & Kappa) and
regression (RMSE & MAE) algorithms and select the best
performance.
